A computational toolbox for analyzing single cell Hi-C (high-throughput sequencing for 3C) data which includes functions for:
1. Load single-cell HiC datasets
2. Smoothing the contact maps with linear convolution, random walk or network enhancing
3. Calculating embeddings for single cell HiC datasets efficiently with reproducibility measures include InnerProduct, HiCRep and Selfish
