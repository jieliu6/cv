# Biography

I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Genome Sciences Department at the University of Washington. My research areas are machine learning and its applications in biomedical informatics. 

I will join as an assistant professor in the <a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics"> Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics </a> at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in January 2019. Interested students/postdocs can reach out to me via email.
