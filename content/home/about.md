# About

Dr. Liu's research lab aims to develop machine learning approaches for real-world bioinformatics and medical informatics problems. We believe that computational methods are essential in order to understand many of these molecular biology problems, including the dynamics of genome conformation and nuclear organization, gene regulation, cellular networks, and the genetic basis of human diseases. 

Liu Lab currently has openings for graduate students and postdocs. Please reach out to Dr. Jie Liu via email if you are interested.
