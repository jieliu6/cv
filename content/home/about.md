# About

I received my Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Genome Sciences Department at the University of Washington before joining  <a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics"> Department of Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics </a> at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor as assistant professor in January 2019. 

My research areas are machine learning and its applications in biomedical informatics. I have positions available for graduate students and postdocs. Please reach out to me via email if you are interested in joining my lab.
