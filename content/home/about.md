# Biography

I received my Ph.D. in computer science (together with a master in statistics) from the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dpage/">Prof. David Page</a>, <a href="http://www.stat.wisc.edu/~cmzhang/">Prof. Chunming Zhang</a> and <a href="http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/People/faculty/burnside.htm">Dr. Elizabeth Burnside</a>. I am currently a Moore/Sloan Data Science Postdoctoral Fellow in the world-renowned Genome Sciences Department and eScience Institute at the University of Washington, mentored by <a href="https://noble.gs.washington.edu/~wnoble/"> Prof. William Noble</a>, <a href="http://melodi.ee.washington.edu/~bilmes/pgs/index.html">Prof. Jeffrey Bilmes</a> and <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/hemeweb/research/blau.htm">Dr. Tony Blau</a>. In both my PhD stage and postdoc stage, the advising team is __$\pi$-shaped__, with __one methodology mentor__ strong in machine learning/statistics (Prof. Zhang and Prof. Bilmes), __one medical doctor__ who embrace data science and genome science in their medical research and practice (Dr. Burnside and Dr. Blau), and __one lead mentor__ strong in linking machine learning methodologies to biomedical applications (i.e. Prof. Page and Prof. Noble). Their combined strength fosters my interdisciplinary research in machine learning and its applications in biomedical informatics (e.g. precision medicine).
